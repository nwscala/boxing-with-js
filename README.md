# Boxing With JS
This application allows the user to create an item with a name, size, and description and to place it in a box with a name, size, color, and a list of all the items stored in it. The user can click on a button under each box to see this list and can click this button again to close the list. The user can also delete specific box-item relationships by clicking the corresponding button at the bottom of each individual itemList html element.
